# HFS
A Favourite Talent auto-selector for Heroes of the Storm.

Simply run the program, and hit "Start", and when you're playing the game any talents that you have favourited will be auto-selected for you.

Was built with 1920 x 1080 resolution in mind. However, it "should" work with most other resolutions. However, it's important to note that your game resolution must match your displays resolution. And you must be playing in fullscreen mode, or fullscreen(windowed) mode.
